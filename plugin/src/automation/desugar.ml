(*
 * Translate a fixed-point function into an elimination form.
 *
 * This function works by transforming the fixed point to use simple recursion
 * (i.e., to quantify the inductive type like a dependent eliminator), calling
 * desugar_recusion, and then wrapping the translated elimination form to conform
 * to the original fixed point's type.
 *
 * Note that the resulting term will not satisfy definitional equality with the
 * original term but should satisfy most (all?) definitional equalities when
 * applied to all indices and a head-canonical discriminee. Still, this could
 * impact the well-typedness of inductive proof terms, particularly when
 * rewriting the unrolled recursive function by an inductive hypothesis. We will
 * know more after testing compositional translation of a complete module, which
 * will avoid incidental mixtures of the old version (by named constant) and the
 * new version (by expanded definition). (Such incidental mixtures arise, for
 * example, in some of the List module's proofs regarding the In predicate.)
